**1** ( Here is the puzzle chart PDF )[/c/Users/germa/Downloads/progLangChartPuzzle.pdf]  
A. The languages in chronological order: Fortran, lisp, Algol 58, basic, sh, C, C++, Fortran 90, Java, Python, Java Script, C#   
B. Here are the languages and the decades they were devolped: Fortran the 50's, list and Algol the late 50's, basic the 60's, sh and C the 70's, C++ the 80's, Fortran 90 Java and Python during the 90's, Java Script the mid 90's, and C# the beginning of the 2000's.   
**2** ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer   
**3** This is how the computer stores and understands information.     
**4** The fastest part of the computer memory is Cache memory.  
**5** The slowest storage device is a disk.  
**6** The smallest unit is a bit.  
**7** A. Assembly  
      B. Yes, they would need an assembler to interpret the data.  
**8** A. Fortran is the oldest high level language.  
      B. Fortran was developed in the 50's.  
**9** A. Assembly is a second generation language.  
      B. Fortran, C, and C++ are all third generation. While Python, MATLAB, and R are fourth generation.  
**10** The 70's, 80's, and 90's.  
**11** An ancestor to C is B.  
**12** An ancestor to C++ is C with Classes.  
**13** An ancestor to MATLAB is h, and an ancestor to Python is ABC.  
**14** The fastest part is the Registers.  
**15** The smallest memory unit is a byte.  
**16** The register is faster than RAM by 4 magnitudes.  
**17** RAM is faster by 1 or 2 magnitudes.  
**18** RAM is 50 times faster than HDD.  
**19** Transitors act as mini on and off switches.  
**20** There is a limit to how many transitors can be added on to a computer due to physical space. 
**21** The three tasks are fetching, analyzing or decoding, and executing.  
**22** Yes, this is possilbe. It depends on the computers speed to access the memory.  
**23** The bottlneck is the memory access, or the RAM.  
**24** Dennard and MOSFET are the same, and they state that as transitors get smaller, they're power density will stay the same. While Moore's Law states that the number of transitors in an IC will double rougly every 2 years.  
**25** 1. For the last square, it would have 64 grains of rice.  
       2. The total number of grains would be 2080.  
       3. The total number of pounds needed would be roughly 0.3.  
**26** 1. Number of grains needed in the last square would be roughly 9.2E-18.  
       2. The total number of grains is roughly 3.6E-19.  
       3. The total number of pounds needed would be roughly 5.3E-15.  
       4. The number of years it would take to make that much rice would be 2635.  
**27** Turning complete, or a Turning Machine is something that can take a program, run it, and give a result. Those are the three components to it. Taking, running, and answering. Analogous to the three tasks accomplished by a CPU.
