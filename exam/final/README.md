**1** Model validation would be saying that the model is complete and ready to be used and presented. Model calibration would mean that it could be calibrated, or fixed/changed in a few ways.   
**2** Aesthetics in data visualization are literal aesthetics, or tools used to visualize and represent data. Some examples would be using different line widths when comparing different types of data on the same graph.   
**3** The best color scale would be the bottom one, because the top one is green and red. And some people may be red-green color blindness, and wouldn't be able to distinguish the differences in the colors if used.   
**4** A. This one is a qualitative color scale, used to help distinguish discrete data in graphs or maps.   
B. This one is a sequential color scale, used to help differentiate data that has smaller and larger magnitudes to it. Like temperature.   
C. This one is a diverging color scale, used to help diplay things that can start from a middle/neutral ground. Like in surveys.   
D. This is and accent color scale, used to help highlight very specific points of data.   
**5** Obersvation/inference, experiment, and prediction.   
**6** These are not the same thing, as the logical implication of snow is that it is cold. But just because it is cold, does mean it will cause it *to* snow.   
**7** 1. No it is not a good fit, because it quite literally doesn't fit most of the data. Yes it does follow the last tail end of the data, but we want something that will fit most of the data.  
2. I would say that the uncertainty is epistemic, due to our *lack* of knowledge of global temperature the further we go back in the timeline.   
3. It would be positive correlation due to the trend line going up more and more towards a certain value.   
4. Yes it could because the data is recorded throughout time.   
5. 0.070925267   
**8** This would be Bayesian, and Classical but that is what sort of turned into Bayesian.   
**9** This, again would be Bayesian and Classical.   
**10** This would be the Frequentist school of probability, because it relies entirely on there being abundent data to sort through and make predictions from. There is no *evidence* that we have to show whether God is real or not. We can't keep track and magically make mircales happen to record and predict how often they happen.      
**11** This visualization is wrong because it is quantifing ages before 0 years old. How can you be 0 years old?   
**12** Everything is represented in intgers to help better represent real numbers. Because there are an infinite amount of real numbers, which makes it hard to represent in a computer, but a series of integers can help represent the rest of those real numbers. Including the ones in between.   
**13** An ancestor to C is B.   
**14** Fortran.   
**15**     
**16** If we have the following truth table corrsponding to logical implication,

Then it should follow that if we inverse the order, i.e. B implies A, and we negate it, then the truth values should be the same.   

**17** There is deductive and inductive. Deductive is based entirely on known facts, like the classic example of man is mortal, Socrates is a man, therfore Socrates is mortal. The other, being inductive is like making observations and making educated guesses. We don't know all of the facts, but we can learn more by finding more. Like at a crime scene.  
**18** It means they are equal in truth value.   
**19**   
**20** No, we can't represent every real number in a computer due to there being an inifinite amount of real numbers.   
**21** The answer is 561, I did this using the series summation formula. I know this because I'm a math major, and I've had to use it many times this semester.
