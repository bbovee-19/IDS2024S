1. [Here is the README file I created](../../README.md)  
2. Local, Centralized, and Distributed.  
3. The Distributed VCS is the best because it resolves the issues of the former two systems, where one is completely centralized. Putting all teams members at risk for total data loss. And the other system not being able to collaborate at all.
4. Git Commands
a.  git pull will bring the most recent revision of the project to your local repository from the remote.   
b.  git status is exactly as it sounds like, it allows you to check on the status of your project.  
c.  git add --all will add all new or modified files to the staging area.   
d.  git commit - m"latest build" will commit the most recent staging area files to your local repository.  
e. git push --all will take your project and all its branches and push them to the remote repository.
