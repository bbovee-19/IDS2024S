**1**  The three pillars of science are as follows: Experiment, Thoery, and Computation.    
**2**  There's predictive computing, numerical simulation, and data driven discovery. Predictive computing can be such things as predicting when a seizure might occur. Numerical simulation could be such things as statistical analysis of a population. And data driven discovery would be something like keeping track of an animal population through AI.   
**3**  The two types of scientific reasoning are deductive and inductive.   
**4**  A logical implication would be, " Because it's snowing, it's cold outside". The snow is not the physical cause for it being cold, rather it's the other way around.   
**5**  The police man make his decision through inductive reasoning. If the policeman heard a bulglar alarm, saw broken glass on a jewelry store, then it most plausible that the man walking out the window with a bag of jewels is most likely the bulglar.
