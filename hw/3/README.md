**1**  The three pillars of science are as follows: Experiment, Thoery, and Computation.    
**2**  There's predictive computing, numerical simulation, and data driven discovery. Predictive computing can be such things as predicting when a seizure might occur. Numerical simulation could be such things as statistical analysis of a population. And data driven discovery would be something like keeping track of an animal population through AI.   
**3**  The two types of scientific reasoning are deductive and inductive.   
**4**  A logical implication would be, " Because it's snowing, it's cold outside". The snow is not the physical cause for it being cold, rather it's the other way around.   
**5**  The police man make his decision through inductive reasoning. If the policeman heard a bulglar alarm, saw broken glass on a jewelry store, then it most plausible that the man walking out the window with a bag of jewels is most likely the bulglar.

**12** a. The tiniest piece of informatioin is a bit.  
b. A bit represents the tiniest bit of information because it only has two parts to it. Either something exists, or it doesn't. This allows us Further make relations with other things that do, or could exist. From there we can make observations about other such things that exist and compare them to each other. This can lead to many such things like coming up with a standard measurement of distance.   
c. Boxes
1. We can represent 2 different possibilities with one such box.
2. With 2 boxes we can represent 4 different possibilities.
3. Finally with 3 such boxes we can represent 6 different possibilites.
