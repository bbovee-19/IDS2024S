The three pillars of science are as follows: Experiment, Thoery, and Computation.    
There's predictive computing, numerical simulation, and data driven discovery. Predictive computing can be such things as predicting when a seizure might occur. Numerical simulation could be such things as statistical analysis of a population. And data driven discovery would be something like keeping track of an animal population through AI.   
The two types of scientific reasoning are deductive and inductive.   
A logical implication would be, " Because it's snowing, it's cold outside". The snow is not the physical cause for it being cold, rather it's the other way around.   
The police man make his decision through inductive reasoning. If the policeman heard a bulglar alarm, saw broken glass on a jewelry store, then it most plausible that the man walking out the window with a bag of jewels is most likely the bulglar.
