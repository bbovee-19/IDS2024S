**6**  The first desidereta of Prbability Theory is that 1. Degrees of plausibility can be represented with real numbers.  
2. Qualitative correspondence with common sense.   
And 3. Consistency, where we can find a conclusion that can be reasoned out more than one way, we also consider all relevant information to the question, and finally we must represent equivalent states of knowledge by quivalent plausibility assingments.
