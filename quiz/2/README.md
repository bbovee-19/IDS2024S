**1** The fastest part of the computer memory is the register.  
**2** To help better address the problem between CPU and memory access speed.  
**3** The slowest storage is a disk.  
**4** Registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, DRAM, and Disk.  
**5** The smallest unit is a bit.  
**6** Because it is very easy to represent 0 and 1 electronically. They can used to represent such things as on or off.  
**7**     
**8** The early 1900's.  
**9** Also the early 1900's.  
**10** These were some of the earliest computers, and called fixed-program because the could only perform the algorithm they had been physically wired to do.   
**11** A calculator.  
**12** A declarative statement is one of fact. It is a stated fact. An imperative statement is one explaining what is to be accomplished.  
**13** a. Declarative   
       b. Declarative  
       c. Imperative  
       d. Imperative  
       e. Imperative  
**14** Declarative and Imperative.  
**15** ENIAC  
**16** Python  
**17** Fortran  
**18**     
**19** ENIAC  
**20** Fortran, COBOL, B, C++, Java, Python.  
**21** A. Assembly   
       B. Yes, it needs interpretation by an assembler.  
**22** A. Fortran   
       B. Fortran was developed during the 50's.  
**23** A. Assembly is a second generation language.  
       B. Fortran, C, and C++ are third generation. While MATLAB, Python, and R are fourth generation.  
**24** 70's, 80's, both MATLAB and Python during the 90's.  
**25** An ancestor to C is B.  
**26** An ancestor to C++ is C with Classes.  
**27** An ancestor to Python is ABC.  
**28** As a math major I understand the logrithm to be the inverse of exponential.  
**29** Using the partial sums formula I take the value of n number of terms, which is 33. Multiply that by the first and last term added together, being 33x102. Equalling 3,366, and dividing that by 0.5, or 1/2. The final answer should be 1,683.
