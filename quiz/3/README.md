**1** We take a natural phenomena, make observations, consturct models based on the observation, and make predictions from those models.  
**2** Experiment, thoery, and computational models.  
**3** There is predictive computing, numerical simulations, and data driven dicovery.   
**4** There is deductive and inductive, also known as plausible, reasoning. For deductive, we start with known facts and make assumptions based on those facts. For example, all men are mortal, Amir is a man, therefore Amir is mortal. 
For inductive reasoning, we can take the policeman and jewelry store question from the homework. If a policeman hears a bulglar alarm, and sees a man crawling out of a broken window with jewelry in hand,
then it is most plausible that the man walking out the window is the bulglar.  
**5** No they're not. For example, a logical implication would be seeing that it is snowing outside. Implying that it is cold outside. But the snow is not the physical 
cause for it being cold. Rather, because it's cold outside there is a likelyhood for it to snow.  
**6** Boolean Algebra is named after George Boole.

**9** In Boolean Algebra when two things are equal, it means that they have an equal *truth* value. It doesn't mean that they have the exact same value.
