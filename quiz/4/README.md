**1**  The four major definitions or schools of probability are Classical, Frequentist, Bayesian, and Propensity.  
**2** The school of probability that relies on degrees of confidence would be the Frequentist school.  
**3** The school of probability that relies on degrees of prior knowledge and scientific inference is the Classical and Bayesian schools.  
**4** This would be the Classical school of probability.   
**5** Frequentist - George Boole.  Bayesian - Edwind Jaynes.   
**6** The range of probability is either from 0 - 1, or from 1 - infinity. This is a necessity because between 0 and 1, this is defining the possible likelyhood for something to occur. But between 1 and infinity is means that it is occuring, has occured.   
**7** I would be more likely to trust the person who said that they saw a horse. Because I've more often than not seen more horses around Arlington than I have donkeys. This principle of probability is Bayesian, because I'm allowing my prior knowledge and inferences about Arlington to make my decision.
