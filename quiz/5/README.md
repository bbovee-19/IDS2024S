**1** Aesthetics are exactly what the word is. They're visualizations used to help literally visualize data.   
**2** Continuous and discrete.   
**3** A factor is used to represent qualitative data, while levels represent categories within that data.  
**4** The two major types of data are qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative can be something like representing different animals in data. Quantitative is numbers, or numerical data. Like recording the temperature of several states.  
**5** A common name for varibales holding data are called factors.  
**6** Ordered data would be something like a survey, where they have an intrinsic order to the answers. Ranging from bad to good. An example of unordered data would be catergorizing animals and comparing which one is more common in households. There is not intrinsic order to the animals.  
**7** The cycle of the seasons could be modeled in polar cooridinates.  
**8** A qualitative color scale helps to distinguish discrete items of data. A sequential color scale can help to visualize data that has a magnitude to it, like temperature. We need to be able to visualize which values are smaller or greater. 
Similar to the sequential color scale, there's also the diverging color scale. Which starts in the middle with a neutral color, and diverges to both sides with different colors to represent things. This would help if we wanted to visualize data from a survey, and plot it on a map of a state. 
A final color scale is an accent scale, which helps to indicate a certain point of data that is important, or one that stands out from the rest.  
**9** They tend to avoid 3D models because it could warp peoples understanding of the data. It also just makes it messy sometimes.  
**10** Age could be represented as either numerical or categorical. Because we could group people into age ranges, and plot it with a histogram. To distinctly represent each age group seperately. Or we could take a large amount of data from an entire population and plot everybodies age continously against whatever it is we're measuring from them.  
**11** Color itself I believe is categorical/unordered. Because we have no way of showing color numerically, it just is simply color. And there is no order to color, because what colors people like are entirely sujective.  
**12** All of the coordinate systems are valid, it just depends on the type of data you're representing with it. I would argue though that the black is *the* most valid, due to it being the most uniform and even.   
**13** The bottom color scale would be better to use due to it not being green and red. Because some people may have red-green color blindness, and won't be able to distinguish the colors from one another.  
**14** Chicago is the least varying city, due to the circle being smaller. The most varying is death valley, due to the circle being the largest. The hottest city during January is Chicago. The coolest city during July is San Diego.   
**15** A. Qualitative   
B. Sequential  
C. Diverging   
D. Accent   
**16** An accent color scale was used here.  
**17** While it does show which movies are making more money, it does it in an odd way. People may be confused thinking that Star Wars is more popular, instead of it simply making more money. Instead the axes shoule be flipped flopped, then people would have an easier time understanding it.

**19** I believe that the temperature is slowly increasing towards 1.5 C. Hopefully though we can cool it a little before then.
